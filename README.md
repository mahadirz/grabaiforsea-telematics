# Grab AI For SEA Safety Challenge

# Introduction
In this reposity I consider myself exploring method of binary classifying driving behavior into safe and unsafe. The safety behavior were manually labelled by trip's passengers hence part of the data could have been said to have bias towards multipe reasons that probably unexist in the dataset such as car model, gender, time of the trip, road condition, weather and etc.

To get understanding of the telematic data, I've had voluntarily recorded my own driving data and part of the analysis and the dataset is released publicly on [Kaggle](_).

Also couple of literatures were reviewed related to telematics and driving behavior to get rough idea on how this type of problem is tackled, primarily I found article and video from Uber is aspiring, [here](https://eng.uber.com/telematics/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s8ZPVNKsGk).
